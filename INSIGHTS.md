# Financial Insights & Interpretation

## Market Behavior
The stock prices show clear long-term upward and downward cycles rather than random movement. This indicates the presence of market trends and investor sentiment patterns.

## Returns Distribution
Daily returns approximately follow a normal distribution, meaning most price changes are small while extreme movements are rare but possible.

## Moving Averages
When the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, the stock typically enters an upward trend (bullish signal). The opposite crossover suggests a potential downward trend.

## Correlation Between Stocks
Certain companies move similarly, indicating sector-based behavior. Highly correlated stocks react similarly to market conditions.

## Risk vs Return
Stocks with higher volatility provide higher potential returns but also higher risk. Stable stocks show smaller fluctuations but more predictable performance.

## Forecasting
The forecasting model predicts future price movement based on historical patterns. The confidence interval shows uncertainty, which is natural in financial markets.

## Seasonality
The seasonal decomposition suggests repeating behavior over time, meaning past patterns partially influence future performance.
